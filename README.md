# restro-reach-backend
The backend of the application is responsible for handling the API requests from the frontend, processing the form submissions, and interacting with the MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval. It is built using TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which adds type checking and additional features to the language.
